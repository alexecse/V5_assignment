# What Has Statistics To Do With It?

Statistical tools and reasoning can significantly enhance the clustering and analysis of HTML documents. From feature selection to quality evaluation, here's a structured breakdown of where statistics could play a key role.

---

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Distributions** of HTML tag frequencies across documents
- **Boxplots** to visualize tag variance and outliers
- **Correlation analysis** between tags
- **Density plots** for tag richness or text length

ðŸ“Œ Use EDA to:
- Choose good filtering thresholds (e.g., `min_total_freq`)
- Detect noisy or rare tags

---

## 2. Feature Scaling and Normalization

Applying statistical transformations helps balance features:

- **Z-score normalization** for standard deviation control
- **Min-max scaling** to fit within [0, 1]
- **Log(1 + x)** transform for skewed tag distributions

ðŸ“Œ Prevents domination by frequent tags and stabilizes distances.

## 3. Statistical Testing Between Clusters

Compare groups with:
- **ANOVA**, **t-tests**, or **Kruskal-Wallis** on:
  - Tag count
  - Content length
  - Visual features (e.g., color count)

ðŸ“Œ Validates that groups are statistically distinguishable.

## 4. Cluster Quality Metrics

These metrics evaluate how well your clusters are formed:

- **Silhouette Score** â€” cohesion vs. separation
- **Daviesâ€“Bouldin Index**
- **Dunn Index**
- **Intra/Inter-cluster variance**

ðŸ“Œ Used to tune `eps`, `min_samples`, or switch distance models.

## 5. Dimensionality Reduction

Statistical techniques like:

- **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis)
- **t-SNE**
- **UMAP**

ðŸ“Œ Help visualize clustering results and detect structure or noise.

---

## 6. Outlier Detection

Statistical techniques can reinforce or replace DBSCANâ€™s logic:

- **Z-score thresholds**
- **IQR (Interquartile Range)**
- **Mahalanobis Distance**

ðŸ“Œ Identify pages that are structurally or semantically abnormal.

## Summary

Statistics is not just about analysis â€” itâ€™s a powerful engine for:

- Better features
- Smarter decisions
- Reliable cluster validation
